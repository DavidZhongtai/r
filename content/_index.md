# Welcome!

Hi! Welcome to all things R here!

## Getting Started

To get started, there is both a side navigation bar as well as a search bar for topics. This is meant to be a reference to most things covered in the class. To return back to this page, you can click the `STAT400 R Guide` link at the top left corner. In addition to that, all of the links and content can be reached on the sidebar. If you cannot find anything, please use the search bar before resorting to asking on Discord.

**Note:** The search functionality may be limited in the first few minutes of using this website if it is your first time visiting and the browser has not cached the search index. After a few minutes when the index is constructed on-premise, the search functionality is expected to be fully working.

## Who, What, and Why?

If you are here, the reason is most likely to check out and learn how R can be used to further your career in statistics. As you progress throughout the class, we will have many interactive sessions that depend on R. This resource was made with hopes that it is a guide and toolbook for the aspiring statistician. Meanwhile, feel free to check out my [main website here](https://davidan.dev) where I write about fun tech and math things.

## Making contributions

The site is maintained by using a static site generator on top of a GitHub Repository. If you would like to make changes to this site, feel free to make a [pull request here](https://github.com/DavidZhongtai/r) inside of the `doc` folder. This work is licensed by the MIT Open Source License.
